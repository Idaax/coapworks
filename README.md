This repository contains a collection of SDKs , samples and guides to work with [CoAPWorks](https://coapworks.com) APIs.

## Idaax.CoAPWorks.CoAPAPI.NET.Sample
This sample showcases how we can use the CoAPSharp library (.NET Standard) and communicate with the CoAP APIs exposed by CoAPWorks.

This package provides wrapper classes for a field deployed device to perform the following:

1. Get current UTC date and time
2. Get pre-configured location time (You setup GPS co-ordinates of the machine in CoAPWorks portal)
3. Get location time based on longitude and latitude
4. Get machine settings (The configuration items for your field deployed machines that are maintained at the server side)
5. Send email alert from the machine
6. Send a machine heartbeat
7. Send machine feeds for storage
